# Alvin Ailey

Alvin Ailey was an African-American choreographer who founded the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and created emotionally powerful works celebrating African-American culture and the human spirit.

He studied with [[Martha Graham]], [[Doris Humphrey]], and [[Charles Weidman]], incorporating their modern techniques into his distinctive style. Ailey was also influenced by [[Katherine Dunham]]'s approach to incorporating African and Caribbean dance traditions.

His masterpiece "Revelations" (1960) is one of the most performed modern dance works in the world. Other notable works include "Cry", dedicated to his mother and all Black women, and "The River" with music by [[Duke Ellington]].

Ailey's company became a platform for showcasing Black dancers and choreographers. He influenced choreographers like [[Judith Jamison]], who later directed his company, and [[Dwight Rhoden]].

His work drew from spirituals, blues, and jazz, collaborating with musicians and connecting to the work of [[Pearl Primus]] and other pioneers of African-American concert dance.
