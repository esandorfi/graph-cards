# Merce Cunningham

Merce Cunningham was an American dancer and choreographer who revolutionized modern dance through his use of chance operations and his separation of dance from music and design.

A student of [[Martha Graham]], Cunningham developed his own technique that emphasized the spine and precise footwork. He rejected Graham's psychological approach in favor of pure movement exploration.

Cunningham's collaborations with composer [[John Cage]] were legendary, where dance, music, and design were created independently and brought together only in performance. This approach influenced [[Trisha Brown]], [[Lucinda Childs]], and many postmodern choreographers.

His dance company, founded in 1953, was known for its rigorous technique and experimental approach. He used computer technology and motion capture in his later works, collaborating with visual artists like [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]].

Notable works include "Summerspace", "RainForest", and "Biped". His legacy connects to [[Paul Taylor]], who also danced with Graham, and influenced contemporary choreographers like [[William Forsythe]].
