# Jerome Robbins

Jerome Robbins was an American choreographer and director who excelled in both ballet and Broadway musical theater, creating a unique American style that bridged classical and popular dance.

He danced with [[George Balanchine]] at New York City Ballet and was deeply influenced by both Balanchine's neoclassical style and [[Martha Graham]]'s dramatic approach. Robbins created "Fancy Free" at age 25, launching his choreographic career.

His Broadway masterpieces include "West Side Story", "The King and I", and "Fiddler on the Roof". In ballet, he created "Dances at a Gathering", "The Goldberg Variations", and "Glass Pieces" for [[Philip Glass]].

Robbins influenced a generation of choreographers including [[Twyla Tharp]], [[Susan Stroman]], and [[Christopher Wheeldon]]. He worked extensively with [[Leonard Bernstein]] and collaborated with [[Stephen Sondheim]].

His style combined Balanchine's musicality with theatrical storytelling and American vernacular movement. He mentored dancers at both NYC Ballet and in commercial theater.
