# William Forsythe

William Forsythe is an American choreographer who revolutionized ballet through his deconstruction of classical technique and incorporation of improvisation and technology.

He was influenced by [[George Balanchine]]'s neoclassical approach and [[Merce Cunningham]]'s experimental methods. His work bridges [[Pina Bausch]]'s theatrical innovation with ballet's formal structure.

## Techniques
- Improvisation technologies
  - Real-time composition
  - Instant decision-making
  - Structured spontaneity
- Architectural choreography
  - Installation-based works
  - Spatial relationships
- Classical deconstruction
  - Extended ballet vocabulary
  - Off-balance positions

## Major Works
- "In the Middle Somewhat Elevated" (1987)
- "Impressing the Czar" (1988)
- "Enemy in the Figure" (1989)
- Installation works:
  - "Nowhere and Everywhere at the Same Time"
  - "Black Flags"
  - "City of Abstracts"

His Frankfurt Ballet period influenced [[Crystal Pite]] and [[Akram Khan]] in their approaches to contemporary ballet.
