# Martha Graham

Martha Graham was an American modern dancer and choreographer, known as one of the pioneers of modern dance. Her unique technique and innovative approach revolutionized the art form.

She founded the [[Martha Graham Dance Company]] in 1926 and developed the Graham technique, which emphasized contraction and release of the torso. Graham was influenced by [[Isadora Duncan]] and later influenced [[Merce Cunningham]] and [[Paul Taylor]].

Her notable works include "Appalachian Spring" with music by [[Aaron Copland]], "Night Journey", and "Cave of the Heart". She collaborated frequently with [[Louis Horst]] as her musical director.

Graham's psychological approach to dance was revolutionary, exploring themes of passion, rage, and spiritual struggle. She worked with [[Jerome Robbins]] and influenced [[Twyla Tharp]] in later generations.
