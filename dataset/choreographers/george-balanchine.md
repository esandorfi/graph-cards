# George Balanchine

George Balanchine was a Georgian-American ballet choreographer, widely considered one of the most influential choreographers in the history of ballet. He co-founded the New York City Ballet and created the "Balanchine style" of neoclassical ballet.

Born in Russia, Balanchine trained at the Imperial Ballet School and later worked with [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and the Ballets Russes. He was influenced by [[Michel Fokine]] and [[Marius Petipa]], the great masters of classical ballet.

His neoclassical approach influenced countless choreographers including [[Jerome Robbins]], [[Peter Martins]], and [[Christopher Wheeldon]]. He collaborated extensively with composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] and created masterpieces like "Serenade", "Symphony in C", and "Jewels".

Balanchine's philosophy emphasized pure dance over narrative, famously saying "ballet is woman." His technique focused on speed, precision, and musicality. He mentored dancers like [[Suzanne Farrell]] and worked alongside [[Lincoln Kirstein]] to establish ballet in America.
