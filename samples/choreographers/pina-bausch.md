# Pina Bausch

Pina Bausch was a German dancer and choreographer who created a new form of expressive dance theater (Tanztheater) that combined dance, theater, and everyday gestures.

She studied with [[Kurt Jooss]] and was influenced by [[Mary Wigman]]'s expressionist dance. Bausch's work explored human emotions, relationships, and social issues through repetitive movements and theatrical elements.

Her Tanztheater Wuppertal became world-renowned for pieces like "Café Müller", "Kontakthof", and "Vollmond". She influenced contemporary choreographers including [[Sasha Waltz]], [[Akram Khan]], and [[Crystal Pite]].

Bausch's work featured unusual staging - seasons with real earth, water, or flowers on stage. Her collaborative process involved asking dancers personal questions that became material for her pieces.

She worked with composer [[Thom Willems]] and influenced the development of European dance theater. Her legacy connects to [[William Forsythe]]'s theatrical approach and the work of [[Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker]].
