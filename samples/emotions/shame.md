# Shame

Shame is a painful emotion that involves feeling fundamentally flawed, inadequate, or unworthy as a person. Unlike [[guilt]], which focuses on specific actions, shame attacks one's core sense of self.

Shame relates to [[humiliation]], [[embarrassment]], and often masks behind [[anger]], [[depression]], or perfectionism. It can develop into [[self-hatred]] or manifest as social withdrawal.

## Shame vs Related Emotions

## Origins and Triggers

## Healing and Growth

- Transforming shame into [[empathy]] for others
- Moving toward [[confidence]] and authentic self-expression

Shame often underlies [[anxiety]], [[depression]], and relationship difficulties, but can be healed through understanding and compassionate support.
