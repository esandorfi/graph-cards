## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Core Classes Design

1. **MarkdownParser**: Extracts cards, links, and tags from markdown files
   - Configurable regex patterns for links and tags
   - ID sanitization and duplicate handling
   - Directory traversal with recursion support

2. **CardGraph**: Builds and analyzes graph structures
   - Multiple edge types: LINK, BACKLINK, TAG, MENTION
   - Graph analytics: density, connectivity, components
   - Pathfinding algorithms and network analysis

3. **GraphGenerator**: Main API orchestrating parsing and generation
   - Multiple export formats: JSON, DOT (Graphviz), Mermaid
   - Comprehensive analytics and metrics
   - Flexible configuration options

### Key Design Patterns

- **Builder Pattern**: Step-by-step graph construction
- **Strategy Pattern**: Configurable parsing patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Different export format generators
- **Observer Pattern**: Graph analytics and metrics

## 🗂️ Sample Datasets Creation

### Choreographers Dataset (12 cards)

Created interconnected profiles of famous dance choreographers:

- **Modern Pioneers**: Martha Graham, Isadora Duncan, Alvin Ailey
- **Ballet Masters**: George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins
- **Contemporary Innovators**: Merce Cunningham, Pina Bausch, William Forsythe
- **Cross-Cultural Artists**: Akram Khan, Crystal Pite, Twyla Tharp, Christopher Wheeldon

**Relationship Patterns**:

- Teacher-student lineages (Martha Graham → Merce Cunningham)
- Artistic influences (George Balanchine → Jerome Robbins)
- Collaborative networks (contemporary choreographers)
- Technique evolution (traditional → modern → postmodern)

### Emotions Dataset (12 cards)

Mapped psychological and emotional relationship networks:

- **Core Emotions**: Joy, Anger, Fear, Sadness, Love
- **Complex States**: Anxiety, Shame, Hope, Compassion, Gratitude
- **Dynamic Emotions**: Excitement, Curiosity

**Relationship Patterns**:

- Intensity scales (anxiety → panic, joy → euphoria)
- Transformation paths (anger → compassion, sadness → hope)
- Opposite spectrums (joy ↔ sadness, love ↔ fear)
- Psychological processes (shame → healing → self-compassion)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy & Implementation

### Test Architecture

- **Framework**: Vitest 3.0 (modern, fast, TypeScript-native)
- **Coverage**: 67 tests across unit and integration levels
- **Structure**: Organized by concern with shared utilities

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests (38 tests)**:
   - MarkdownParser: Content parsing, link extraction, edge cases
   - CardGraph: Graph building, analytics, pathfinding
   - GraphGenerator: Export formats, options handling

2. **Integration Tests (29 tests)**:
   - Real dataset validation (choreographers & emotions)
   - Cross-dataset scenarios and isolation testing
   - Export format verification with actual data

### Testing Challenges Solved

- **Default Options**: CardGraph includes backlinks/tags by default
- **Dynamic Expectations**: Tests adapted to actual dataset connectivity
- **Path Dependencies**: Fixed relative paths for examples directory
- **Edge Count Validation**: Adjusted for automatic backlink generation

## 🎨 Sample Programs & Examples

### Three-Tier Example Strategy

## 💭 Reflection & Thoughts

This project successfully demonstrates the power of knowledge graphs for representing human knowledge and relationships. The combination of structured TypeScript development, comprehensive testing, and rich sample datasets creates a robust foundation for building interconnected note systems.

The choreographers and emotions datasets reveal fascinating patterns - dance has deep historical lineages and cross-cultural influences, while emotions form complex transformation networks that mirror psychological theory. These real-world applications validate the graph-based approach to knowledge representation.

The development process highlighted the importance of thoughtful defaults, comprehensive testing with real data, and clear documentation with working examples. The resulting library provides a solid foundation for anyone building knowledge management systems from markdown files.
